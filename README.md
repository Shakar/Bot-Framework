# Bot-Framework
###In this project we will try to add a new module to the original [Microsoft BotFramework](https://dev.botframework.com/).
####Fork repository located [here](https://github.com/Shakar/BotBuilder)

A bot is a web service that interacts with users in a conversational format. 
Users may start conversations with the bot from any channel which was configured to work on (for example: *Text/SMS*, *Skype*, *Facebook Messenger*, and other popular services). 
Bot conversations may be freeform, natural language interactions or more guided ones with provided choices or actions. 
The conversation can utilize simple text strings or something more complex such as rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons.

The framework consists of the __Bot Builder SDK__, __Bot Connector__, __Developer Portal__, and __Bot Directory__. Thereâ€™s also an emulator that can be used to test the bot.

This is a big platform, which is intended for __developers__ (not for simple users) who want to build a robot as smart as possible.

My project purpose is not to build a robot (although I probably will, along the way to get to know the system better)
But  to add/edit a model system which will contribute an additional capabilities to other developers who want to build a robot.
